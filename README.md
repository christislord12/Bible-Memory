# Bible-Memory
A Java Program to Store Bible Verses You've Memorized
The program stores the verses in empty JPG files in the "verses" folder. There is an example verse saved in the build.
The bible.txt is from EBible.org "https://ebible.org/find/show.php?id=eng-kjv" and contains the 1769 Cambridge KJV with Apocrypha. You may use any VPL Bible text file with this program.
